# Backend Foundations: The Rookie Handbook (Universal)

---

## Module 0: The Command Line & OS (The Environment)

**Goal:** Learn to control the computer without a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The backend developer's home is the Terminal.

### 1. The Operating System (Linux/Unix)

Most servers in the world run on Linux. You don't need to install Linux today, but you must understand how it thinks.

- **The File System:** Servers are just files and folders.
- **Permissions:** Who is allowed to read this file? Who is allowed to execute this program? (Read/Write/Execute).

### 2. The Shell (Bash / Zsh / PowerShell)

You must navigate the computer using text commands.

- **Navigation:** `cd` (Change Directory), `ls` (List files), `pwd` (Where am I?).
- **File Ops:** `mkdir` (Create folder), `touch` (Create file), `rm` (Delete).
- **I/O Streams:** Understanding that every program has an Input (Standard In) and an Output (Standard Out).

### 3. How the Internet Works (DNS & IP)

- **IP Address:** Every computer has a number (like a phone number).
- **DNS:** The phonebook that turns `google.com` into a number.
- **Ports:** If the IP is the House Address, the Port is the specific Room (e.g., Port 80 is the Web Server room, Port 22 is the SSH room).

### ✅ Module 0 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You can navigate your hard drive using only the Terminal.
- [ ]  You can create and delete files without a mouse.
- [ ]  You can explain what "Localhost" means (It's your own computer).

## Module 1: Programming Logic (The Script)

**Goal:** Pick **one** language and learn to write logic.
*(Recommended for Rookies: Python or JavaScript/Node.js due to ease of learning).*

### 1. Variables & Data Types

The backend is about processing data. You need containers to hold that data.

- **Strings, Integers, Booleans.**
- **Collections:** Arrays (Lists) and Objects (Dictionaries/HashMaps). This is how you structure complex data like a "User Profile."

### 2. Control Flow

- **Conditionals:** `If this, then that`. (The brain of the server).
- **Loops:** Doing the same task 1,000 times instantly. (The muscle of the server).

### 3. File I/O (Input/Output)

A backend program must be able to read files from the hard drive and write new files.

- **Task:** Write a script that opens a text file, counts the number of words, and saves the result to a new file.

### ✅ Module 1 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You have installed a programming language runtime (Python, Node, Go, etc.).
- [ ]  You can write a script that runs in the terminal.
- [ ]  You can write a loop that iterates through a list of data.
- [ ]  You can read and write to a text file using code.

---

## Module 2: HTTP & The Network (The Conversation)

**Goal:** Understand how computers talk to each other. This is language-agnostic.

### 1. The Request / Response Cycle

- **The Client:** Asks for something (Request).
- **The Server:** Listens, processes, and answers (Response).
- **Statelessness:** The server forgets who you are the moment it finishes sending the response.

### 2. HTTP Methods ( The Verbs)

The intent of the action.

- **GET:** asking for data.
- **POST:** sending new data to be saved.
- **PUT/PATCH:** updating existing data.
- **DELETE:** removing data.

### 3. Status Codes (The Scoreboard)

The universal language of "How did it go?"

- **200-299:** Success (OK).
- **400-499:** Client Error (You messed up).
    - *404:* Not Found.
    - *401:* Unauthorized (Login needed).
- **500-599:** Server Error (I messed up / Code crashed).

### 4. API Testing Tools

- **Postman / Insomnia:** Since you aren't building a Frontend yet, you need a tool to act as the "Client" to test your backend.

### ✅ Module 2 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You can explain the difference between GET and POST.
- [ ]  You know what a 404 and a 500 error mean.
- [ ]  You have installed Postman (or use cURL) and successfully requested data from a public API (like `google.com`).

---

## Module 3: Databases (The Memory)

**Goal:** Learn how to store data permanently.
*(Note: We focus on Relational/SQL first because it is the foundation of data organization).*

### 1. Relational Databases (SQL)

Imagine an Excel spreadsheet, but strictly defined and super fast.

- **Tables:** The sheets (e.g., "Users", "Products").
- **Rows:** The individual entries.
- **Columns:** The attributes (Name, Email, Price).

### 2. Basic SQL Queries

You don't need to be an expert, but you must know the Basics.

- `SELECT * FROM Users` (Show me everyone).
- `WHERE age > 18` (Filter).
- `INSERT INTO` (Add data).

### 3. Data Modeling

- **Primary Keys:** Every row needs a unique ID.
- **Relationships:** How to link a "Post" to a "User" (Foreign Keys).

### ✅ Module 3 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You have installed a GUI for Databases (like DBeaver or TablePlus).
- [ ]  You can write a SQL query to select data from a table.
- [ ]  You understand what a "Table" and a "Row" are.

## Module 4: The Web Server (Frameworks)

**Goal:** Build a program that listens on a specific "Port" and responds to internet traffic.

### 1. Choosing a Framework

Don't write a raw server from scratch (unless you are using Go/Rust). Use a standard framework to handle the heavy lifting.

- **The Concept:** A library that handles routing (URLs) and parsing incoming data.
- *Common Choices:* Express (Node.js), FastAPI/Flask (Python), Spring Boot (Java), Gin (Go), [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) Core (C#).

### 2. Routing (The Traffic Control)

- **Endpoints:** You define specific URLs like `/users` or `/products/123`.
- **Path Parameters:** Capturing variable data from the URL (e.g., in `/users/55`, the `55` is the ID).
- **Query Parameters:** Capturing filters (e.g., `/users?sort=desc`).

### 3. Middleware (The Pipeline)

- **Concept:** Functions that run *before* your main logic.
- **Usage:** Logging ("User accessed page at 10:00 PM"), Validation ("Is the email valid?"), or Authentication ("Is this user logged in?").

### ✅ Module 4 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You can spin up a server that runs on `localhost:8080`.
- [ ]  You can create a GET route that returns JSON data.
- [ ]  You can create a POST route that accepts JSON data and prints it to the console.
- [ ]  You understand what a "Port" is (and why two programs can't use the same one).

---

## Module 5: Database Integration (Persistence)

**Goal:** Connect your server to a real database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) so data survives a restart.

### 1. The Database Driver / Client

- **Concept:** The code library that allows your programming language to talk to the Database.
- **Connection String:** The URL that contains your DB credentials (IP, Username, Password).

### 2. ORM (Object Relational Mapper) vs. Raw SQL

- **Raw SQL:** Writing `SELECT * FROM users` directly in your code. (Fast, but harder to maintain).
- **ORM:** Using code classes to represent tables. e.g., `User.findAll()`.
    - *Examples:* Prisma/Sequelize (Node), SQLAlchemy (Python), Hibernate (Java), Gorm (Go).
    - *Advice:* Start with an ORM to learn the logic, then learn Raw SQL later for performance.

### 3. Environment Variables (.env)

- **Security Rule #1:** NEVER write your database password directly in your code.
- **The Solution:** Store secrets in a hidden file called `.env` and read them into the program at runtime.

### ✅ Module 5 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You have a database (Postgres/MySQL) running (locally or in the cloud).
- [ ]  You can connect your server code to the database.
- [ ]  You can save an entry to the DB via a POST request (Create).
- [ ]  You can retrieve an entry from the DB via a GET request (Read).

---

## Module 6: RESTful Architecture (The Design)

**Goal:** Organize your endpoints in a way that other developers expect.

### 1. REST Principles

- **Resources:** Think in Nouns (`/books`), not Verbs (`/getBooks`).
- **Standard Methods:**
    - `GET /books` (List all)
    - `GET /books/1` (Get one)
    - `POST /books` (Create)
    - `PUT /books/1` (Update)
    - `DELETE /books/1` (Remove)

### 2. Status Codes (Advanced)

- **201 Created:** Specific success code for POST.
- **400 Bad Request:** The user sent bad data (missing fields).
- **404 Not Found:** The ID requested doesn't exist in the DB.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Your code crashed.

### 3. Project Structure (MVC / Layered)

Stop writing all code in one file.

- **Controllers:** Handle the HTTP stuff (Requests/Responses).
- **Services:** Handle the Business Logic (Math, Validation).
- **Repositories/Models:** Handle the Database calls.

### ✅ Module 6 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You have refactored your "One File Server" into multiple folders.
- [ ]  Your API returns correct Status Codes (not just 200 for everything).
- [ ]  You have a clear separation between "Routing" and "Database Logic".

---

## Module 7: Authentication Basics (The Gatekeeper)

**Goal:** Know the difference between "Who are you?" and "What can you do?"

### 1. Passwords & Hashing

- **The Golden Rule:** Never store a plain-text password in a database.
- **Hashing:** Transforming "password123" into generic gibberish (e.g., `$2a$12$R9h...`) using libraries like **Bcrypt**. You verify login by hashing the input and comparing it to the stored hash.

### 2. Authentication (AuthN)

- **Concept:** Verifying identity.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** The modern way to handle logins. When a user logs in, you give them a signed digital "badge" (Token). They send this token with every future request.

### ✅ Module 7 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You can accept a password, hash it, and save the hash to the DB.
- [ ]  You can verify a login attempt by comparing the input against the stored hash.
- [ ]  You understand why storing plain text passwords is a security vulnerability.

## Module 8: Docker & Containers (Shipping)

**Goal:** Solve the "It works on my machine" problem forever.

### 1. What is a Container?

- **The Problem:** Your server needs specific versions of Node/Python, specific libraries, and specific OS settings. Setting this up on a new server takes hours.
- **The Solution (Docker):** You package your Operating System, your Language Runtime, and your Code into a single lightweight box called a "Container."
- **The Result:** If the container runs on your laptop, it is guaranteed to run on any server in the world.

### 2. Dockerfile & Image

- **Dockerfile:** The recipe script (e.g., "Start with Linux, Install Python, Copy my code, Run app").
- **Image:** The frozen artifact created from the recipe.
- **Container:** The running instance of the Image.

### 3. Docker Compose

- **Concept:** Running multiple containers together (e.g., Your API + Your Database + Redis Cache) with one command: `docker-compose up`.

### ✅ Module 8 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You can write a `Dockerfile` for your API.
- [ ]  You can build an Image and run it locally.
- [ ]  You can use Docker Compose to spin up your API and a Database instantly.

---

## Module 9: Testing (Quality Assurance)

**Goal:** Write code that verifies your logic automatically.

### 1. Unit Testing

- **Concept:** Testing isolated functions. (e.g., "Does the `calculate_tax` function return the correct number?").
- **Mocking:** Faking external dependencies. You don't want your unit tests to actually hit the real credit card API or the real database.

### 2. Integration / API Testing

- **Concept:** Testing the actual HTTP Endpoints.
- **Flow:** Spin up a test database -> Send a POST request to `/users` -> Check if the user is actually in the database -> Wipe the database.

### 3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration)

- **Concept:** A robot (like GitHub Actions) that runs your tests every time you push code. If the tests fail, the robot blocks the merge.

### ✅ Module 9 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You have written a Unit Test for a business logic function.
- [ ]  You have written an Integration Test that hits an endpoint and checks the response code.
- [ ]  You understand what "Mocking" is.

## Module 10: Caching & Performance (Speed)

**Goal:** Make your API survive 10,000 users at once.

### 1. The Bottleneck

- **The Truth:** Databases are slow (relatively). Reading from a hard drive takes time.
- **The Solution:** Caching. Storing frequently accessed data in RAM (Memory).

### 2. Redis

- **The Tool:** The industry standard for caching. It is a Key-Value store that lives entirely in RAM.
- **Strategy:** Before checking the Database, check Redis.
    - *If found (Hit):* Return data instantly.
    - *If not found (Miss):* Check Database, save to Redis, then return.

### 3. Indexes (Database Optimization)

- **Concept:** A "Table of Contents" for your database. Without an index, the database has to scan every single row to find "John Doe." With an index, it finds him instantly.

### ✅ Module 10 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You can spin up a Redis instance (via Docker).
- [ ]  You can implement a simple caching layer in your API logic.
- [ ]  You can explain when to use an Index in SQL.

---

## Module 11: System Design & Architecture (The Big Picture)

**Goal:** Understand how to build systems that don't crash under pressure.

### 1. Microservices vs. Monoliths

- **Monolith:** One giant codebase that does everything (User, Billing, Shipping). Easier to start, hard to scale.
- **Microservices:** Many small, independent servers talking to each other. Hard to manage, infinite scale.

### 2. Message Queues (Async Communication)

- **The Problem:** Sending an email takes 2 seconds. If a user signs up, you don't want the request to hang for 2 seconds while waiting for the email to send.
- **The Solution (RabbitMQ / Kafka):**
    1. User signs up.
    2. API adds a "Send Email" job to a Queue.
    3. API responds "Success" instantly.
    4. A background worker picks up the job and sends the email later.

### 3. Load Balancing

- **Concept:** Having 5 copies of your API server running behind a "Traffic Cop" (Load Balancer like NGINX). The Load Balancer distributes the traffic so no single server gets overwhelmed.

### ✅ Module 11 Success Criteria

- [ ]  You understand the difference between Synchronous (HTTP) and Asynchronous (Queues) communication.
- [ ]  You can draw a diagram of a Scalable Architecture (Load Balancer -> API Cluster -> Database + Cache).
